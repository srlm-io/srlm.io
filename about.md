> Red9 helps users draw insights from large amounts of dynamic motion sensor data. Our technology helps athletes perform better with the equipment that they already have, and helps designers build the latest in high performance products.

At Red9 I developed the hardware recorder PCB and firmware, an Android app, a data analytics web platform, and a marketing website. Check out my [blog post](https://srlm.io/2018/02/17/red9-data-science-platform/) for details on what I did. Check out [libpropeller](https://github.com/libpropeller/libpropeller) for an open source, lean and efficient C++ library optimized for the Parallax Propeller that I developed while working for Red9.

## B.S. Computer Science
